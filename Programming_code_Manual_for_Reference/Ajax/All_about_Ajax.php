<!-- Why is Ajax needed -->

AJAX = Asynchronous Javascript and XML

- In the traditional scenario, when a HTTP request is made the user has to wait for the HTTP response (this is received when the page is refreshed)

- Javascript interacts with the server in real time
- the data returned is formatted in XML format

- It is a web development technique used for sending and retrieving data in the background without refreshing the webpage
