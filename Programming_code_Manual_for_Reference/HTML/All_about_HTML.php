<!-- What is HTML -->

- stands for Hypertext Markup Language
- is used to structure and display a web page and its content

<!-- What are block level and inline level elements -->

1. Block level elements
  - form a visible block on the page
  - they will appear in a new line from whatever content went before it and any content
   that goes after it will also begin on a new line

  Eg - paragraphs, list, navigation menus, footers etc.

2. Inline level elements
  - are contained within block-level elements and surround only small parts of the document's content
  , not entire paragraphs and groupings of content
  - will not cause a new line to appear in the document
  - they would normally appear inside a "paragraph"

  Eg - anchor, "em", "strong" etc.
