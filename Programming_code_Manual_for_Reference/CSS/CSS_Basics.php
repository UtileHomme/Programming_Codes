<!-- What is CSS -->

- it is a style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document
written in a markup language
- adds style to your html
- can completely control how the web pages look without changing your HTML

An Analogy
  - Imagine a fence has been built using HTML
  - The painting etc. is done using CSS

- If the fonts mentioned in the font-family selector are not found, then the browser will upload its default font-family
